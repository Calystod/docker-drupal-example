# docker-drupal-example
This is a project example to launch Drupal 8 with Docker

First information
-----------------

This project's goal is to present simply how to create a docker environment for people who have never worked with
Docker before. This project focuses on Drupal specifically but can be adapted to work with other technologies.

You can find documentation links and commentaries below. If you want to improve or correct errors, you can fork this project and do
a pull request.

To know how to assign a static IP to containers, you can checkout the docker-networks branch. But this branch is still 
work in progress and this approach isn't recommanded except if we want access to container on external networks.

Prerequires
-----------
Before launching the project for the first time, you need to install some components on your environment.

### On Debian or Ubuntu

* Docker CE

For Linux:
* [Installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) for Ubuntu
* [Installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/) for Debian
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

For Mac OS:
* [Installation page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
 
For Windows:
* [Installation page](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows)

> **Important**: Docker on Linux doesn't work exactly the same way it does on Mac OS and Windows. On these two last
> environments, Docker works with the Docker Toolbox. It's an application which contains all elements necessary for Docker
> together with the Docker Machine and some experimental features enabled by default.
>
> This project is realized on Linux, so the documentation could be incomplete or wrong for Mac OS and Windows.

First launch
------------

To up your containers, launch:

```docker-compose up```

If it's your first launch, this command will build your containers too.

Let the `up` run and go in an other tab on your terminal.

To execute commands on your environment, you will used the php-cli container. To go in, launch:

`docker-compose run --rm php-cli bash`

If you want, you could create an alias for this command.

When you enter in the php-cli container, you should be in /var/www/html

Launch the command:
`composer install`

Many things will be installed:

* Drupal core
* Drush

You can open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1/

> Warning: This is true on Linux, not on Windows Home where you must connect to the IP of the VirtualBox machine which run. It needs to be tested on Mac OS and Windows Pro.

Install your new website.

The database credentials are:

* Database name = docker_test (-> If you boostrap a new project based on this project, you should change the value of the environment variable in the .env file)
* Database user=drupal
* Database password=drupal
* Host=db (it's the name of the container which runs MariaDB)

You can use phpMyAdmin with [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

Other informations:

In the file .env, the USER_UID must match with the USER_UID of your personnal user to have the same right.

Verify your user id with the command:
`id -u`

and change the data in the .env if necessary. You can used an utility like [direnv](https://direnv.net/) or a global variable.

and enjoy !
